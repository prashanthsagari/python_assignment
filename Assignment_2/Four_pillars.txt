4 Pillars:
**********
Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing necessary functionality.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary functionalities.
Polymorphism: Allowing different classes to have methods with the same name but different behaviors.
Inheritance: Allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
